	Swell Foop is a puzzle game, of which the objective is to clear 
	the window of as many pieces as possible by clicking on groups 
	of the same colored pieces. That group will vanish and the 
	pieces on top will fall until there are none left or no more 
	color groups.

  <sect1 id="introduction"> 
    <title>Playing &app;</title> 
    <para>&app; is a puzzle game. The goal is to remove as many objects as possible in as few moves as possible. Objects that are adjacent to each other get removed as a group. The remaining objects then collapse to fill in the gaps and new groups are formed. You cannot remove single objects.</para>

    <para>The board starts as a full grid of objects. Depending on the size of board you select, there are either three or four types of object. If a group of objects are adjacent and all the same type, then they can be removed simply by clicking them with the mouse (or by pressing the space bar). When you move the mouse over a group you can remove, the objects will start moving. The number of objects in the group, and the points you will score for removing that group, is shown in the lower left corner of the window.  The more objects in the group, the more points you will score. Once the group has been removed the objects above them fall down to fill the space. If an entire column is cleared then the objects slide leftward to fill the gap.</para>

    <sect2 id="changing-the-look">
      <title>Changing the Look</title>
      <para>Changing the size of the objects is as simple as resizing the window. To make the maximum use of the screen choose the <guimenuitem>Fullscreen</guimenuitem> option from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.</para>

      <para>To change the appearance of the objects use the <guimenuitem>Theme</guimenuitem> item in the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu. Selecting an item from the list changes the theme immediately.</para>

        <para>You can also create your own themes, although the process is not very straight-forward yet. Use a copy of an existing theme as a template and alter it with your favorite paint program. Put the result in <filename>$XDG_DATA_HOME/gnome-games/swell-foop/themes/2.10/</filename>. It will be automatically included on the themes list next time you run &app;. <filename>$XDG_DATA_HOME</filename> is usually <filename>~/.local/share/</filename>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="changing-the-size">
      <title>Changing the Size</title>
      <para>The <guimenu>Size</guimenu> menu contains three settings: small, medium and large. Aside from increasing the number of objects, the large setting also increases the number of different objects.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="changing-the-speed">
    <title>Changing the Speed</title>
    <para>The default animation is designed to be smooth and graceful. If you like playing fast and furious then this may be too slow for you. By selecting the <guimenuitem>Fast Animation</guimenuitem> option from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu you can speed up game-play at the expense of animation quality.</para>
    </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="swell-foop-strategy">
    <title>Strategy</title>

    <para>The most important rule when aiming for a high score is to think ahead: each group you remove will form and destroy other groups.</para>

<para> Remove higher groups first, unless removing another group will make it larger. Vertically aligned objects can't be misaligned, but horizontal arrangements can.</para>

    <para>Since the score increases quadratically, big groups of objects are always better. For example, the points difference between a six object group and a seven object group is nine points. In a situation where you have a choice between merging two groups of two into four or just adding one more to the group of six then you should add the single object. Even though the groups of two you are left with score no points, the bigger group scores more overall.</para>

    <para>Don't forget the thousand point bonus for clearing all the balls. To get 1000 points from a single group you need 34 objects. You are very unlikely to be in a position where you have to sacrifice a group that large to clear the board.</para>
